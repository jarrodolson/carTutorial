<h1 id="air-conditioning-delete-for-1977-camaro-lt">Air Conditioning Delete for 1977 Camaro LT</h1>
<p>This tutorial provides an overview for individuals removing the stock air-conditioning system in their 2nd generation GM F-Body cars.</p>
<h2 id="parts-required">Parts Required</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] AC Delete Cover (I did the Classic Industries 70-81 ABS AC Delete Cover - #14963 - https://www.classicindustries.com/product/all-years/chevrolet/camaro/parts/14963.html : $139.99)
<ul>
<li>This doesn't fit all that well on my firewall, I had to do some work to shoehorn it in. Specifically, pounding in the raised part of the firewall so that the fan would clear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[ ] Blower Motor Cage for Cars without AC (Classic Industries - #19953 - https://www.classicindustries.com/product/all-years/chevrolet/camaro/parts/19953.html : $19.99)</li>
<li>[ ] Blower Motor Resistor (I got Dorman 973-430 Blower Motor Resistor kit - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FOOUVTW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 : $11.04)</li>
<li>[ ] Blower Fan High relay (I got Four Seasons 35767 Relay - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C2QN9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 : $12.09)</li>
<li>[ ] Wire loom wrap</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools-required-as-i-recall">Tools Required (as I recall)</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Sockets (not deep) [1/4, 3/8, 5/16]</li>
<li>[ ] Knife (for cutting water hoses)</li>
<li>[ ] Bucket (for collecting coolant)</li>
<li>[ ] End wrenches matching sockets</li>
<li>[ ] Wiring pliers</li>
<li>[ ] Electrical testing indicator light</li>
<li>[ ] Drill with 1 3/4&quot; bit and 1&quot; bit (although, could have gone just a bit smaller on the 1&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tear-down">Tear Down</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Disconnect current electrical terminals to resistor, relay, and all corresponding connectors.</li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Disconnect and mark both water lines to heater (mark upper and lower).
<ul>
<li>These were difficult to remove and should be cut from the heater core to avoid damaging the sauter of the piping to the core.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove heater fan.
<ul>
<li>Electrical connections (ground and power) and the interference sink (big metal cylinder).</li>
<li>Clean air hose should be unscrewed from current AC suitcase.</li>
<li>Small bolts around fan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove bolts holding suitcase together (it has to be removed in 2 parts to fit).
<ul>
<li>2xTop, 2xSide, 2xBottom (these are nearly impossible to access on the bottom with headers installed).</li>
<li>I ended up disconnecting top and side and then breaking bottom.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove bolts holding cover in place.
<ul>
<li>One at the bottom, near the headers is nearly unreachable. With a lot of patience, used a 3/8 end wrench from underneath.</li>
<li>One in top left of the box, above the heater fan (to the top right) is hard to see.</li>
</ul></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Test Wires and cap unnecessary wires, see table 1.
<ul>
<li>I capped off the green wire, and was already using the tan (power) wire out of the firewall for the choke. I split that off to also run the cowl switch.</li>
<li>I left the yellow (low) on the new resistor disconnected to avoid the constant power state. This would have been the green wire.</li>
<li>Remember to connect ground to ground wire that will connect to blower motor.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Install blower motor in box.
<ul>
<li>I got new bolts because I felt like the self-tapping screws would not be adequate in the non-metal frame of the box.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mock up and check clearances
<ul>
<li>Had to flatten the hole in the firewall where the fan goes (clipped the lip inward and then hammered pieces in)</li>
<li>Added self-tapping holes and cut out pre-drilled holes in the box that didn't line up perfectly. The studs coming out of the firewall mostly did not align or could not hold nuts.
<ul>
<li>Top right above the blower fan had a very large washer on it, and then I started it before putting the box on. That way I could just slide the delete box into place (it has a groove not a hole).</li>
